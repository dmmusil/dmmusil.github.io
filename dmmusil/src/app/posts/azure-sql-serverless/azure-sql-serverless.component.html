<h2>Cost control and cold start with Azure SQL Serverless</h2>
<h6>June 19th, 2022</h6>

<h3>What is Azure SQL serverless?</h3>
<p class="mt-3">
  Azure SQL serverless tier can scale between the requested vCore value all the
  way down to 0.5 vCores. It can also pause after an hour of inactivity. When
  paused, you only pay for the data storage.
</p>

<h3>Actual costs</h3>
<p>
  There's a fairly opaque and innocuous looking cost value on the pricing page:
  $0.0001740/vCore-second. That looks like it's basically free. However they
  also provide the hourly cost and it's not free. It's 62 cents per hour per
  vCore. This is actually very expensive for something billed as "serverless".
</p>
<p>
  The key to making it cheap is to allow it to pause when it's not in use. In
  order for this to happen, there must be no activity for 60 minutes. However,
  when it's paused you can't use it. No connections, no queries, no health
  checks from your app. Nothing. Now that it's stopped and essentially free, the
  challenge is that it takes 30+ seconds to start up again.
</p>

<h3>Dealing with cold starts</h3>
<p>
  The first connection attempt against a paused database essentially triggers
  Azure to grab the database file from a storage blob and mount it into a SQL
  Server container. This takes upwards of a minute so your app must tolerate
  this.
</p>
<p>
  If using Entity Framework you should already be using
  <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency"
    target="_blank"
    >EnableRetryOnFailure</a
  >. This will retry 6 times by default when a transient failure is detected.
  However this isn't enough to deal with a paused serverless database because
  the execution strategy created by <code>EnableRetryOnFailure</code> doesn't
  see connection failures as transient. You also need to add a large connection
  timeout to the connection string. The default timeout on the connection
  strings you get from the portal is 30 seconds. In my testing, I saw the
  database take ~70 seconds to wake up and respond to a query so a connection
  timeout of 120 seconds was added to the connection string,
  <code>Connection Timeout=120;</code>.
