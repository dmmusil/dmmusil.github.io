  <p>
    I'm a backend developer at
    <a href="https://degreed.com/about" target="_blank">Degreed</a>
    who focuses on developer experience and our DevOps transformation. I am
    passionate about making dev work more enjoyable by making things easier to
    use and faster to set up, change, and deploy.

  <p>
    I live in the Finger Lakes region of New York where I spend the summers
    playing golf and enjoying all there is to do in the northeast and the
    winters skiing around New York, Vermont, and the west.

      DevOps team - May 2020 to present
      <p>
        In early 2020 we identified the need to start a DevOps transformation as
        we weren't releasing often enough and had lots of opportunities to
        improve developer experience and productivity. Having a dedicated DevOps
        team is a bit of an anti-pattern, and the hope is that we will dissolve
        when our mission is complete. We want to modernize hosting and
        deployments to enable the fast flow that DevOps aims to achieve.
        <br /><br />
        I coordinate directly with the VP of DevSecOps and the architects to
        make sure that we are aligned and working together toward our long term
        goals of supporting a loosely coupled, global application that can be
        hosted in multiple clouds and continuously deployed.
        <br /><br />
        My team also provides SRE support to the rest of the engineering org. We
        are responsible for monitoring the health of the core platform and
        providing support to teams that need help with specific troubleshooting.
        I have developed a solid understanding of debugging systems through the
        use of logging, metrics, and APM via Datadog and am skilled at
        diagnosing issues and adding new data as needed to make SRE work more
        sustainable.

            </li>
            <li>
              Refreshed database automation from Powershell to C# to support the

            </li>
            <li>
              Designed, implemented, and educated peers on new integration

          2022 - broad improvements to developer experience, promoted to Staff
          engineer for contributions to long term improvements and leadership
          <ul>
            <li>
              Constantly searched for and made changes to improve the speed of
              deployments, tests, and PR checks to allow developers to spend
              less time waiting and more time doing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented hosting and deployment patterns that enabled
              continuous delivery in new services using Kubernetes, Docker,
              Github Actions, and Terraform. Train teams on how to build,
              operate, and maintain CD pipelines and implement applications
              using patterns that are compatible with CD like backwards
              compatibility and versioning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Guided migration of primary application hosting from the
              deprecated Azure Cloud Services to the more modern Azure App
              Services. This required extensive optimization of network
              chattiness as App Services were a bit more resource constrained.
              Specifically this included optimizing the way the app uses Redis.
              I implemented a layered caching strategy using Redis pub/sub and
              in-memory caching to reduce the amount of Redis calls by 50%. This
              improved latency of the web requests by nearly 50%.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supported a dozen product teams as they create and deploy new
              software components. Educated on building pipelines, automated
              test suites, and monitoring and logging. Provided containerized
              development environments for all new services.
            </li>
            <li>Automated deployment of Elasticsearch changes.</li>
            <li>
              Automated creation of SQL Server container whenever database
              changes were merged. This container is used for local integration
              and acceptance testing of database or Entity Framework code
              changes. Additionally this container is used in PR checks to speed
              them up when there are no database changes. Rather than building
              the database from scratch we can reuse the existing image to run
              tests against.

          2023 - improving local development and speed of innovation
          <ul>
            <li>
              Improved local monitoring for Redis with MiniProfiler to detect
              duplicate calls. Set up Seq to improve the local logging
              experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Participated in migration of Elasticsearch hosting from VMs to
              Kubernetes using Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes. Set up monitoring
              and automated deployments for dozens of ECK clusters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced provisioning time for new services from days to hours by
              creating reusable Github workflows, Helm charts, template
              repositories, and Nuget packages. Lead training sessions on use of
              these tools to empower teams to own their deployments and
              configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Researched and implemented managed workload identity to allow
              applications to access infrastructure without needing to use
              secrets. No more secret rotation or manual configuration changes!
            </li>
            <li>
              Continued to advocate for and demonstrate automated testing and
              TDD to allow increased speed and innovation while ensuring high
              quality output.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simplified management of local development environments with
              Docker Compose for running and managing all infrastructure
              dependencies. This includes Redis, Elasticsearch, SQL Server, and
              a custom messaging solution to allow the two data stores to stay
              in sync using the existing code and infrastructure. Provide
              automated tooling to set up and maintain local environments
              whenever new changes are submitted that affect the data or
              schemas. Produce and execute training and provide support for the
              roll out of the improved local development experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed overall modernization of development and deployment
              practices, mainly consisting of deploying more parts of the system
              from version control instead of synchronizing from a shared
              development environment. Removed cumbersome manual steps from
              various processes including database and localization deployments.
