  <p>
    I'm a backend developer at
    <a href="https://degreed.com/about" target="_blank">Degreed</a> who focuses
    on developer experience and our DevOps transformation. I love making dev
    work more enjoyable by making things easier to use and faster to setup,
    change, and deploy.
  </p>
  <p>
    I live in the Finger Lakes region of New York with my partner, Kate, where
    we spend the summers playing golf and enjoying all there is to do in the
    northeast and the winters skiing around New York, Vermont, and the west.

      DevOps team - May 2020 to present
      <p>
        In early 2020 we identified the need start a DevOps transformation as we
        weren't releasing often enough and had lots of opportunities to improve
        developer experience and productivity. Having a dedicated DevOps team is
        a bit of an anti-pattern, and the hope is that we will dissolve when our
        mission is complete. We want to modernize hosting and deployments to
        enable the fast flow that DevOps aims to achieve.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Started containerizing the applications and setup initial POC of
          running the stack in Kubernetes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assisted in migration from self-hosted TeamCity to a combination of
          Github Actions and Azure Pipelines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduced deployment times from 50-90% by using "build once, deploy
          anywhere" and blue-green deployments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up monitoring, alerting, and dashboards for all development and
          production environments in Datadog.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rearchitect database automation enabling use of the same tools for
          managing local, remote, and production databases. Added fully
          automated database pipeline that removed the need for manually running
          scripts during releases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Simplified management of local development environments with Docker
          Compose for running and managing all infrastructure dependencies. Used
          Terraform to automate cloud-only dependencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identified and fixed performance issues that resulted in a 50%
          reduction in global response times. Cost savings from the change were
          nearly $4,000 per month.
        </li>

          that implement these patterns. I enjoy tinkering with these ideas
          without much sense of purpose other than to be armed with the

      Golf - In a past life I was an aspiring PGA golf professional. I realized
      that I'd rather continue golf as a leisure activity and I still attempt to
      play good golf. Currently I'm about a 4 handicap once the rust gets
      knocked off in the spring.

      Skiing - I was introduced to skiing on a work trip and fell in love. Since
      taking up the sport seriously in 2019 I've had the privilege of skiing
      about 40 days here in New York and a few days in Tahoe and Vermont.
